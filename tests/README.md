# Testing Strategy for EvoCommsJS

This document outlines the testing approach for the EvoCommsJS application.

## Test Types

We're focusing on these key types of tests:

1. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components and with external systems
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete flows through the application

We've chosen to limit unit tests since they often provide less value than higher-level tests for this type of application.

## Test Directory Structure

- `/tests/integration/` - Integration tests for components and services
- `/tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests for complete flows
- `/tests/helpers/` - Test helpers and utilities

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/integration/terminal-resolution.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Approach

### Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that components work correctly with their dependencies. We mock external dependencies where appropriate but test real interactions between our internal components.

Key areas for integration tests:

1. **Service Layer**: Testing service classes with mocked repositories
2. **Repository Layer**: Testing repository classes with mocked database
3. **API Layer**: Testing API endpoints with supertest

### End-to-End Testing

E2E tests verify that complete business flows work correctly. These tests may interact with a local test database or mock external API dependencies.

Key areas for E2E tests:

1. **Terminal Communication Flows**: Test complete terminal communication workflows
2. **API Endpoints**: Test API endpoints from request to database and back

## Mocking Strategy

We use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate components:

1. **Database Mocking**: We mock Prisma client to avoid real database calls
2. **External API Mocking**: We mock `fetch` for external API calls
3. **Logging Mocking**: We mock loggers to avoid noise in test output

## Future Improvements

- Set up CI integration for automated test runs
- Add performance tests for critical paths
- Consider adding property-based testing for complex scenarios
